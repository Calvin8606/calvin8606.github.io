<li>Crawler<br />
** I needed a crawler to go though my project directory and collect Readme files</li>
<li>Parser<br />
** The parse was made to parse markdown information using libraries like Frontmatter, Goldmark, and HTML/template.</li>
<li>Generator<br />
** The generator produces the HTML file detailing my projects and their descriptions. It also focuses more on the templating aspect.</li>
